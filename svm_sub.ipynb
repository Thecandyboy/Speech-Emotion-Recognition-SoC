In an n-dimensional space, the hyperplane can be represented as:\n","\n","$ w \\cdot x + b = 0 $\n","\n","where \\( w \\) is the weight vector, \\( x \\) is the input vector, and \\( b \\) is the bias term.\n","\n","**Margin**: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point of each class. SVM aims to maximize this margin.\n","\n","**Optimization Problem**: SVM solves the following optimization problem to find the optimal hyperplane:\n","\n","$ \\min_{w, b} \\frac{1}{2} \\|w\\|^2 $\n","\n","subject to:\n","\n","$ y_i (w \\cdot x_i + b) \\geq 1 \\quad \\forall i $\n","\n","where \\( y_i \\) is the class label of the \\( i \\)-th data point, and \\( x_i \\) is the \\( i \\)-th data point.\n","\n","### Objective Function (Optimized version)\n","The objective function of a linear SVM with L2 regularization is given by:\n","\n","$\n","\\min_{w, b} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\|w\\|^2 + C \\sum_{i=1}^n \\max(0, 1 - y_i (w \\cdot x_i - b)) \\right]\n","$\n","\n","Where:\n","- \\( w \\) is the weight vector.\n","- \\( b \\) is the bias term.\n","- \\( C \\) is the regularization parameter.\n","- \\( y_i \\) are the labels {-1, 1}.\n","- \\( x_i \\) are the feature vectors.\n","- \\( n \\) is the number of samples.\n","\n","### Hinge Loss\n","The hinge loss for a single sample is:\n","\n","$\n","L_i(w, b) = \\max(0, 1 - y_i (w \\cdot x_i - b))\n","$\n","\n","### Gradient of the Objective Function\n","To minimize the objective function, we use gradient descent.
